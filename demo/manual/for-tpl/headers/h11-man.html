<h1>Block Header #11</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.
            The navigation bar is hidden now, but you can activate it at any time by just removing the class ".hidden" from 
            <code class="language-markup">&lt;header class="header-11 hidden"&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-11.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-11.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="background"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this elementsent. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">.background {
	background-image:url('your image url’);
	opacity: opacity value;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
		 In the “Less" version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">.opacity(value from 0 to 100);</code></pre>
        <p>
        <p>
            You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This block has a video container where you can put your own video: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="player"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            This block also has a special sign up functionality which is implemented with the following form: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="signup-form"&gt; &lt;form&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. You can send the data from the form to the server or so something else with it.
