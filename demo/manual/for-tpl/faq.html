                        <p>I have pulled the Startup framework from the repository and its components are not displaying properly. What does this mean?</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Startup framework is based on the Flat-UI framework and its repository contains Flat-UI as a project submodule. 
                                The above mentioned situation can happen if you have pulled the project without the submodule. 
                                In order to fix this, you need to execute the following commands in your git console:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>

                            <p>After having done this, the submodule folder 'flat-ui' shouldn't be empty, and Startup components will display correctly.</p>

                        <p>Does Startup framework have any specific CSS classes or it only uses classes from its base frameworks?</p>

                                Startup framework is based on Flat-UI 2.0.0, but it has its own additional CSS classes and LESS mixins

                            <p>
                                You can see it in the special <a href="startup-css-micro.html" target="_blank"

                    <div class="question">
                        <p>I want to use 'LESS'. How can I do it?</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>LESS is included within the same version of Startup framework.</p>

                            <p>
                                In order to develop with "LESS", you should already have set up your development environment for this. 
                                You can read more about it on the <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">official site of the "LESS framework</a>.
