        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block is based on a grid with left and right columns. The left column has a title or a slogan and a feedback form.
            The feedback form was developed as a form element which you can modify if you need to.
            You also need to have an indentificator for it, if you want to use the data from this form to send it to your server or do something else with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The right column of the block has description text which you can modify as you wish,
            and an element <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="phone"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> for the main phone number and availability hours.
            You can replace any of the information in this part, but you should follow the same HTML structure in order to maintain its look.
