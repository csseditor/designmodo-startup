            This block is based on a grid and consists of two parts - top and bottom.
            There is a special area for a map in the top part of the block: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="map"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            In order to use this functionality, you need to have a map in your settings. Simply add your map in this container as an iframe or use another technology if you know exactly what you are doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The bottom part consist of three columns with descriptions.
            These columns have addresses and links to your FAQ section (you should have a page for FAQ). There is also a link for sending email.
            You can modify all of the content in these columns.
