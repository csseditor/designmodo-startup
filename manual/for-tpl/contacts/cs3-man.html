            This block is based on a grid with left and right columns. The left column has a title or a slogan and some text description with links to a phone number and an email address.
            There is a special area for a map: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="map"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            In order to use this functionality, you need to have a map in your settings. Simply add your map in this container as an iframe or use another technology if you know exactly what you are doing.

            The feedback form in this block was developed as a form element which you can modify if you need to.
