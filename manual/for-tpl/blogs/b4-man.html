        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block has a grid layout that consists of two columns.
            The left column has content with a title, text, an image and a slogan.
            You can modify any of these components.
            The right column has navigation menu for the articles in your blog.
            You need to implement the functionality of this navigation yourself.
            On the bottom of this block you can see tags as links.
