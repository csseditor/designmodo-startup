        </p>

        <p>
            <big><strong>Carousel</strong></big>
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see in code we have block <code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="b1-pt-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            - it's main block of the carousel.
            In this block situated few pages <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For thouse elements you can change background, and you can do it in few ways. First way - you can change the
            part of class that start with
            <strong>bg-</strong> for this element. This way you can use reserved classes from Flat-UI, but it changed
            only color of carousels page background.
            Or second way - you can use css for change background for concrete element.
            As example for <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            . You can do something like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">.pt-page-1{
            background-image:url('some image url');
            background-color: some color;
            }</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can change text for any of this carousel pages. For this you should change text in block <code
                class="language-markup">&lt;div class="hero-unit"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            And you can add new pages. For this you should copy one of blocks <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            ,
            replace class as <strong>pt-page-1</strong> to new class.
            Each new page should has new class with new number.
        </p>

        <p>
