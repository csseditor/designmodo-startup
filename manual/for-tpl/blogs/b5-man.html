        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            All you need to do is copy and paste these lines of code between <code class="language-markup">&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt;</code>
            into your HTML file.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-blog/for-tpl/blog-5.html"</code></pre>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>'
            file. Put the following lines after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import 'blog-common.less';
@import 'blog-5.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>
        <p>
            As you can see in code we have block <code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="b1-pt-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>, 
            the main block of the carousel.
            There are a few page elements in this block: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            You can change the background of those elements in a few different ways. One way is changing the part of the class that starts with
            <strong>bg-</strong> for this element. This way you can use reserved classes from Flat-UI, but it will only change the background color of the carousel page.
            Another way is to use CSS to change the background for a specific element.
            As an example for block <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>, you can do something like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>.pt-page-1{
    background-image:url('some image url');
    background-color: some color;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can add text to any of the carousel pages by putting content after <code
                class="language-markup">&lt;div class="box-icon"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
            However, you need to create style for this text yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also add new pages to the carousel. In order to do this, you need to copy one of blocks <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            and change the class <strong>pt-page-1</strong> to new class.
            Each new page should has new class with new number.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can replace any text in the block but you should maintain the HTML structure.
        </p>
