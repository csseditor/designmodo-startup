<h4>All versions</h4>
<p><big><strong>Carousel</strong></big></p>
        <p> As you can see in code we have block <code>&lt;div id="b1-pt-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> - it's main block of the carousel. 
            In this block situated few pages  <code>&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For thouse elements you can change background, and you can do it in few ways. First way - you can change the part of class that start with
            <strong>bg-</strong> for this element. This way you can use reserved classes from Flat-UI, but it changed only color of carousels page background. 
            Or second way - you can use css for change background for concrete element. 
            As example for <code>&lt;div class="pt-page-1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>. You can do something like this: 
            </p>
<pre class="cssCode">
.pt-page-1{
    background-image:url('some image url');
    background-color: some color;
}
</pre>        
<p>You can add text for any of this carousel pages. For this you should add content after <code>&lt;div class="box-icon"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>. 
    But you should create style for this text by yourself.</p>
<p>And you can add new pages. For this you should copy one of blocks <code>&lt;div class="pt-page"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>, 
    replace class as <strong>pt-page-1</strong> to new class. 
Each new page should has new class with new number.</p>
<p><big><strong>Content except carousel</strong></big></p>
<p>You can replace any text except code structure.</p>
