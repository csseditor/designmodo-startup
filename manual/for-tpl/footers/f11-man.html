        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can modify the elements in this block as you wish, but you should keep the same HTML structure to maintain its look and functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like all the other blocks this block is based on a grid. It contains a logo, navigation links and social buttons on top, a slogan in the middle and links in the bottom.
            You need to add your own URLs to the social buttons.
        </p>
