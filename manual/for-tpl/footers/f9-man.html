            This block is based on a grid and consist of two parts - top and bottom.
            The top part of this block has a special container for a map: <code class="language-markup">&lt;section class="footer-9-map"&gt;...&lt;/section&gt;</code>.
            In order to use this functionality you need to have a map within your settings and add that map to the container as an iframe. You can add the map using other technology, but make sure you know what you are doing.

            These columns contain addresses, links to your FAQ section (you should have a page for FAQ) and links for email.
