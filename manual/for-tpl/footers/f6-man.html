        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special footer block.
            All blocks that are marked as footer can only be used once on one page.

    <li>
        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, simply copy and paste the following rows into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-footer/for-tpl/footer-6.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-footer/less/footer-6.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can modify the elements in this block as you wish, but you should keep the same HTML structure to maintain its look and functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has a logo, three columns with navigation links, a subscription form, and a container for social buttons <code class="language-markup">&lt;p class="social-btns"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
            You need to add your own URLs to the social buttons.
            The subscription form is just a text field and a button, so it doesn't have any functionality by default. You need to add your own JavaScript or wrap these elements with a real form tag with the parameters you need.
        </p>
