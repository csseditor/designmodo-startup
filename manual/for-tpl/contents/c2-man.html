        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
           Like all the other content blocks this block is based on a grid.
           You can modify any element of this block, but you should follow the same HTML 
           structure if you want to maintain its look and functionality.  
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has a title, a slogan and an area for buttons and links on the left.
            You need to add your own functionality for the buttons and URLs for the links.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the right side of this block there is special area for video content. 
            To add a video you need to place it inside <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="player"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            This area also has a special 'play' button which you can use for playing the video. However, you need to add the functionality for it yourself.
        </p>
