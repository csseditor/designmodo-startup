        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, simply copy and paste the following rows into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/for-tpl/content-3.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in <a href="#c3-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
         <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/less/content-3.less';</code></pre>
    </li>

        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
           Like all the other content blocks this block is based on a grid.
           You can modify any element of this block, but you should follow the same HTML 
           structure if you want to maintain its look and functionality. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has a title and a slogan on the left.            
            On the right side there is an image and you can replace it with your own.
            This block also has three columns on the bottom, each with a title and a description.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has another nice functionality. You can add class "<strong>mirror</strong>" to the main element of 
            this block: <code class="language-markup">&lt;section class="content-3 v-center"&gt;</code>, and have this layout horizontally mirrored.
        </p>
