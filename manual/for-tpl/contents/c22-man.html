        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like all the other content blocks this block is based on a grid. You can modify any element of this block, but you should follow the same HTML structure if you want to maintain its look and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            This block consists of two columns. The first column has a title, a description and a button.
            You need to develop your own functionality for the button. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second column contains images inside <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="img hidden-phone"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> for creating an animated block.
        </p>
        <p>
            The image container has a class "<strong>hidden-phone</strong>", which means that it will not be visible on mobile devices.
        </p>
