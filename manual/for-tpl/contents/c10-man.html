        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, simply copy and paste the following rows into your HTML file:
        </p>
       <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/for-tpl/content-10.html"</code></pre>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
             Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/less/content-10.less';</code></pre>
    </li>

        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
           Like all the other content blocks this block is based on a grid.
           You can modify any element of this block, but you should follow the same HTML 
           structure if you want to maintain its look and functionality.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The left side of the block has a title, text and blocks with images, titles and descriptions. The right side has a carousel: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="c-10_myCarousel" class="carousel slide"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
        </p>        
        <p>
            In order to change the images inside the carousel you need to replace the image tag within <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="carousel-inner"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>, but you should maintain the HTML structure.
            The carousel has special active indicators under the images, so if you want to add more images you should also add indicators for them.
            The indicators are items in the following ordered list: <code class="language-markup">&lt;ol class="carousel-indicators"&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</code>.
