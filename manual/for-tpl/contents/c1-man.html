        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, simply copy and paste the following rows into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/for-tpl/content-1.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-content/less/content-1.less';</code></pre>
    </li>

        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
           Like all the other content blocks this block is based on a grid.
           You can modify any element of this block, but you should follow the same HTML 
           structure if you want to maintain its look and functionality.  
        </p>
        <p>This block has a special areas for video content with title and description <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="row box-video"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> 
           and two buttons within <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="btns"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.          
        </p>
        <p>
            The video itself is in <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="player"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> and it's using an iframe. To change the video, simply replace this iframe with your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons have normal and hover states, but they don't have any functionality by default, so you should apply your own functionality to it. 
        </p>
