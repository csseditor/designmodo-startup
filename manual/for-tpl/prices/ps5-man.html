        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has three columns with a header, product description and a button which is visible only when the whole box is in hover state. 
            You can customize any of the content in these columns but you should follow the same HTML structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each description has a button, but you need to implement the functionality for it youself.
            All buttons have two states - normal and disabled. To make a button disabled add the class="<strong>disabled</strong>" to the button.
        </p>
