        <p>
            This block has three columns with a header, a price block, product description and a button.
            Any content in these columns is customizable, but you should follow the HTML structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each description has a button, but you need to implement the functionality for it youself.
            All buttons have two states - normal and disabled. To make a button disabled add the class="<strong>disabled</strong>" to the button.
