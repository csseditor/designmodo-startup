                <div class="question">
                    <p>I'm pull the Startup framework from the repository and all of it components have a demaged view. What does it meen?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The Startup Framework based on the Flat-UI framework and it repository contains Flat-UI as project submodule. 
                            So this situation can appears if you pull the project without submodule.
                            For fix it, you should execute thouse commands in
                             your git console: </p>
                            <p><code>git submodule init</code></p>
                            <p><code>git submodule update</code></p>
                        <p>After this submodule folder 'flat-ui' mustn't be empty, and Startup components have to view right way.</p>
