        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
           This block was developed for demonstrating your projects to the users.
            For example, it can be used as a portfolio for a designer.
            All the blocks of this type have special active image areas with hover effects. The functionality behind the click on the images needs to be implemented by yourself.
