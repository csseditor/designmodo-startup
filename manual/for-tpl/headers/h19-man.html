        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block.
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page.
            All header blocks have navigation bar. And any navigation bar has two states.
            Standard state –you can see now in the documentation.
            Second state – fixed-top state and you can see it for this block in the sample.

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of
            this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This block has content which you can replace to yours.
            To make this you should replace content between tags <code>
            &lt;div class="span8"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            And the block has two buttons in this content, you can use these as you wish, you
            can make links or use JavaScript for making special actions for these.
