        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.

        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-22.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css version and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-22.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="background"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">.background {
	background-image:url('your image url’);
	opacity: opacity value;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less" version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">.opacity(value from 0 to 100);</code></pre>
        <p>
            This block has a slogan which you can replace with your own. It is located between <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="span10 offset1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also replace the content in the two columns located between <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="span6"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
    </li>
