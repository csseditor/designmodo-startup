    <li>
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block.
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page.
            But this block is very specific, you can use it as presentation.
            It doesn't has standart navigation bar.
        </p>

        <h3>Code</h3>

        <a id="h7-simple"></a><h4>Simple version:</h4>
        <small>if you not already done all instructions
            that you had to read on the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page
            of this documentation please make it first
        </small>
        <p>
            For using this block you should only paste next rows of code into your html file:
        </p>
        <pre class="htmlCode">
include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-7.html"
</pre>


        <h4>"LESS" version:</h4>
        <small>if you not already done all instructions
            that you had to read on the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page
            of this documentation please make it first
        </small>
        <p>
            you should paste same code (as in <a href="#h7-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a>) and paste next
            code into your '<strong>.less</strong>' file after that
            rows that you already had to paste.
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-7.less';
</pre>
        <h4>All versions:</h4>

        <p>
            So about modifications which you can do.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of
            this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This header block is very specific and you can use it as presentation. So you can use it as wrapper for all
            your site content.
            It has Carousel.
            One slide - one page.
            You can change content for slides of this carousel.
            For this you should replace content inside <code>
            &lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            This block has ‘.background’ tag for slides not for the main block because it has sense (you should have
            chance to change background for anyone of slides).
        </p>

        <p>
            But anyway you can use it as header... It means if you want place content after this block you can do it.
        </p>
