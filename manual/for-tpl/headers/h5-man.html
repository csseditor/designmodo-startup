        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block.
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page.
            All header blocks have navigation bar. And any navigation bar has two states.
            Standard state –you can see now in the documentation.
            Second state – fixed-top state and you can see it for this block in the sample.

        <h3>Installation</h3>

        <p>
            if you not already done all instructions
            that you had to read on the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page
            of this documentation please make it first
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            For using this block you should only paste next rows of code into your html file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-5.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            you should paste same code (as in <strong>simple version</strong>) and paste next code into your '<strong>.less</strong>'
            file after that
            rows that you already had to paste.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-5.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            So about modifications which you can do.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code>&lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of
            this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This block has special functionality – carousel.
            You can change content for slides of this carousel.
            For this you should replace content inside <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>
            This block has ‘.background’ tag for slides not for main block because it has sense (you should have chance
            to change background for anyone of slides).
        </p>

        <p>
            And yet this block has functionality for making search. It was realised as form <code class="language-markup">&lt;form class="navbar-search"&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;</code>
            which data from you can send to the server or do something else.
        </p>
