    This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image. 
    The place for background image - <code>&lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of this element. For example as this:
</p>
<pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>   
<p>
    In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function: 
</p>     
<pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>   
<p>
    This block has special button for goto next content block and collapsed menu.   
    To make this you should replace content between tags <code>&lt;div class="hero-unit"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
