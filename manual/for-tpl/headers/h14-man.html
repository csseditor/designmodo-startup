        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block.
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page.
            This header block doesn't has navigation bar, but you always can add it.

            For using this block you should only paste next rows of code into your html file:
        </p>
        <pre class=" language-markup"><code class=" language-markup">
include "../../../ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-14.html" 
</code></pre>         

        
 <h4>"LESS" version:</h4>

            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code class="language-markup">
                &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</code></pre> 
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</code></pre> 
        <p>
            This block has content which you can replace to yours.
            To make this you should replace content between tags <code class="language-markup">
                &lt;div class="span8 offset2"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
            In this block '.herro-unit' it's only logo!
        </p>
        <p>
            And this block has an form <code class="language-markup">
