        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            So about modifications which you can do.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code>&lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of
            this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This block has content which you can replace to yours.
            To make this you should replace content between tags <code>&lt;div class="hero-unit"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
