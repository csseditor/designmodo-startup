        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block.
            All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. 
            This header block doesn't have a navigation bar, but you can always add it.

        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-4.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in css versionand paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-4.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="background"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode"><code class="language-scss">.background {
	background-image:url('your image url’);
	opacity: opacity value;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            In 'Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode"><code class="language-scss">.opacity(value from 0 to 100);</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can replace the content of this block with your own.
            In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="hero-unit"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
