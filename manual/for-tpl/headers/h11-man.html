<h1>Block for creating header. Codename “header-11”.</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block. 
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page. 
            All header blocks have navigation bar. And any navigation bar has two states. 
            Standard state –you can see now in the documentation. 
            Second state – fixed-top state and you can see it for this block in the sample.
            Now the navigation bar is hidden, but you can activate it. For this you should remove class ".hidden" from this 
            <code>&lt;header class="header-11 hidden"&gt;</code>.
        </p>

 <h4>All versions:</h4>
<p>So about modifications which you can do.</p>
<p>
    This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image. 
    The place for background image - <code>&lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of this element. For example as this:
</p>
<pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>   
<p>
    In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function: 
</p>     
<pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>   
<p>
    This block has content which you can replace to yours. 
    To make this you should replace content between tags <code>&lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> </p>
<p>
    The block has special section for add video - <code>&lt;div class="player"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>. 
</p>
<p>
    And yet this block has special functionality for sing-up, it realised as form  <code>&lt;div class="signup-form"&gt; &lt;form&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
    which data you can send to the server or do something else.
