<h1>Block Header #6</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.

        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
              To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-6.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
		 Copy the same code as in <a href="#h6-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-6.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="background"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:

        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>.background {
    background-image:url('your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less" version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">.opacity(value from 0 to 100);</code></pre>
		<p>
         You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="span8 offset2"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>	
		</p>
        <p>
			This block has an area for video, which you can insert between the tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="player"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            It also has subscription functionality for subscribing which is implemented using the following form: <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="signup-form"&gt; &lt;form&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;</code>. You can send the data from the form to the server or do something else with it.
        </p>
