        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This block was developed as special header block.
            All blocks that marked as header should use once on one page.
            All header blocks have navigation bar. And any navigation bar has two states.
            Standard state –you can see now in the documentation.
            Second state – fixed-top state and you can see it for this block in the sample.
            Now the navigation bar is hidden, but you can activate it. For this you should remove class ".hidden" from this
            <code class=" language-markup">&lt;header class="header-17 hidden"&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>

        <h3>CSS version:</h3>

        <p>
            For using this block you should only paste next rows of code into your html file:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">include "../../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/for-tpl/header-17.html"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LESS version:</h3>

        <p>
            you should paste same code (as in <strong>simple version</strong>) and paste next code into your '<strong>.less</strong>'
            file after that
            rows that you already had to paste.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">@import '../../ui-kit/ui-kit-header/less/header-17.less';</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Component Modification:</h3>

        <p>
            So about modifications which you can do.
        </p>

        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has special place for background image.
            The place for background image - <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            For add your image as background you should add CSS rulers for this element. And you can manage opacity of
            this element. For example as this:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">.background {
            background-image:url(‘your image url’);
            opacity: opacity value;
            }</code></pre>
        <p>
            In ‘Less’ version for opacity property you can use cross browser function:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss">.opacity(value from 0 to 100);</code></pre>
        <p>
            This block has content which you can replace to yours.
            To make this you should replace content between tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="hero-unit"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
            And yet this block has a carousel. For replace content for its slaides please replae it between next tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
