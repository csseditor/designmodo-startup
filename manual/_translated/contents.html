            This block has a special wrapper which uses <code>
                &lt;div class="number"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> elements as animated list markers.
            The list consists of inner blocks. You can use other content blocks inside this block.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two special inner blocks specifically developed for this content block.
            The first special block has a title and some text on the top and an image on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second special block is a carousel.
            You can change the content for any of the slides in this carousel by replacing the content inside <code>
                &lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can add any number of new inner blocks to the numbered list, but you should use the same structure for all of them.
        </p>

            Inner block structure:
        </p>
        <pre class="htmlCode">...</pre>
