<h1>Header block. Codename: “header-22”.</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.

        <h3>Code</h3>

        <a id="h22-simple"></a><h4>Simple version:</h4>
        If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.


        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="htmlCode">...</pre>        

        
 <h4>"LESS" version:</h4>
        If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in <a href="#h22-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
@import '../../ui-kit-header/less/header-22.less';
</pre>
        <h4>All versions:</h4>
        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>
        <p>
            This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This block has a slogan which you can replace with your own. It is located between <code>
                &lt;div class="span10 offset1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also replace the content in the two columns located between <code>
                &lt;div class="span6"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            .
        </p>
