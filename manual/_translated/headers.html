<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.
            The navigation bar is hidden now, but you can activate it at any time by just removing the class ".hidden" from 
            <code>
                &lt;header class="header-11 hidden"&gt;</code>
            .

            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this elementsent. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code>
                &lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
        </p>

            .
        </p>
        <p>
            This block also has a special sign up functionality which is implemented with the following form: <code>

This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.
            The navigation bar is hidden by default, but you can activate it by removing the class ".hidden" from the following element:
            <code>
                &lt;header class="header-17 hidden"&gt;</code>
            .

             This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code>
