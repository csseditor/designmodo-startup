        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.

        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>

            Copy the same code as in <a href="#h1-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:

            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
                &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:

        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:

        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This block has a special functionality carousel. You can modify the content of the carousel slides by replacing the content inside <code>
                &lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            This block has a “.background” attribute for the slides, so you can change the background for any one of slides individually.

            This block was developed as a special header block.
            All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page.
            However, this block is very specific and it does not have a standard navigation bar.
            You can use this block to make a presentation.

            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:

            This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
                &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            This header block is very specific and you can use it as a presentation, so it can be a wrapper for all your site content.
            This block has a carousel where each slide can be one page.
            You can change the content for each of slides by replacing the content inside <code>
                &lt;div class=”pt-page”&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This block has a “.background” attribute for the slides, so you can change the background for any one of slides individually.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use this block as a header, which means if you want place content after this block you can do it.

        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. 
            This header block doesn't have a navigation bar, but you can always add it.

        <a id="h13-simple"></a><h4>Simple version:</h4>
        <small>If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.</small>

        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="htmlCode">...</pre>        

       
 <h4>"LESS" version:</h4>
        <small>If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.</small>
        <p>
            Copy the same code as in <a href="#h13-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
@import '../../ui-kit-header/less/header-13.less';
</pre>
        <h4>All versions:</h4>

            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.
        </p>
        <p>This block, as many other header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
        &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
        To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code>
                &lt;div class="span5 offset1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
            This block also has an image on the right side. These two parts and the logo all have animation effects.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This block was developed as a special header block. All blocks that are marked as header should only be used once on one page. This header block has a navigation bar, which can have two states. The standard state is described further in this documentation and the fixed-top state is shown in the example for this for this block.

        <a id="h19-simple"></a><h4>Simple version:</h4>
        <small>If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.</small>


        <p>
            To use this block, copy and paste the following line of code into your HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre class="htmlCode">...</pre>        

        
 <h4>"LESS" version:</h4>
        <small>If you haven’t already done all the instructions from the <a href="how_to_install.html">how to install</a> page of this documentation, please do that first.</small>

        <p>
            Copy the same code as in <a href="#h19-simple" class="inner-link">simple version</a> and paste it in your '<strong>.less</strong>' file. Put the following line after that code:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
@import '../../ui-kit-header/less/header-19.less';
</pre>
        <h4>All versions:</h4>
        <p>
            In this section you will see what modifications you can do to the block.

        <p>
             This block, as many others header blocks in our framework, has a special place for background image, which is: <code>
            &lt;div class=”background”&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            To put your own image as background you need to add CSS rules for this element. You can also manage the opacity for this element. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.background {
    background-image:url(‘your image url’);
    opacity: opacity value;
}
</pre>
        <p>
            In the “Less” version, you can use the cross browser function for the opacity property:
        </p>
        <pre class="cssCode">
.opacity(value from 0 to 100);
</pre>
        <p>
            You can replace the content in this block with your own. In order to do this you need to replace the content between the tags <code>
                &lt;div class="span8"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            This block also has two buttons, which you can use as you wish. You
            can put links or use JavaScript to perform special actions.
