<p>So about modifications which you can do.</p>

<p><big><strong>Carousel</strong></big></p>
        <p> As you can see in code we have block with id="<strong>b1-pt-1</strong>" - it's main block of the carousel. 
            In this block situated few pages whict have class="<strong>pt-page</strong>".
            For thouse elements you can change background, and you can do it in few ways. First way - you can change the part of class that start with
            <strong>bg-</strong> for this element. This way you can use reserved classes from Flat-UI, but it changed only color of carousels page background. Or second way - 
            you can use css for change background for concrete element. As example for <strong>pt-page-1</strong>. You can do something like this: 
            </p>
<pre class="cssCode">
.pt-page-1{
    background-image:url('some image url');
    background-color: some color;
}
</pre>        
<p>You can change text for any of this carousel pages. For this you should change text in block with class="<strong>hero-unit</strong>"</p>
<p>And you can add new pages. For this you should copy one of blocks with class="<strong>pt-page</strong>", replace class as <strong>pt-page-1</strong> to new class, 
and new class should has new number.</p>
<p><big><strong>Content except carousel</strong></big></p>
<p>You can replace any text except code structure.</p>
